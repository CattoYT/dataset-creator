# Dataset-creator (Koequet)

The $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty}}$ best audio dataset formatter!

This is currently compatible with datasets from [Ai Hobbyist's datasets](https://github.com/AI-Hobbyist/StarRail_Datasets), but in the future will be compatible with as many formats as I care about.  
This currently supports exporting to parquet (hence the shit name), with LJSpeech coming soon!

# Installation
## Method 1: uv
1. Download the src
2. run ```uv sync``` to download dependencies for your GPU
3. run ```uv run src/main.py``` to start!

## Method 2: pre-built nuitka binary
1. Download the binary
2. Pray
3. Run the .exe
4. pray
5. ???
6. profit?

Please just do method 1. Also method 2 is already outdated 💀  
Method 2 is also completely untested on any device other than my own soooooo your mileage may vary. I can guarantee method 1 works though.
